<h1 style="color: black;">Architecture Peers</h1>
<p style="color:blue;"> When freshmen enter university for the first time it can be overwhelming. It is a totally new environment, very different from high school. The way your schedule flows is different, how you register for class is different, how you meet new people is different. Some people begin leaving on campus on their own, which is different. Architecture students go through all these changes on top of having a very different learning environment compared to everyone else. Architecture students have a studio class, which puts them into a hands-on, project based learning environment. Here they learn how to design ideas to solve problems.  Considering these changes, peer mentors specifically for architecture are a great resource. They guide students through assignments, give general advice, and can even offer personal support. However, the system in place for contacting these peer mentors is inefficient. They have separate emails and a general one for almost 200 students. Our platform will create an ease in the process of seeking assistance from these peer mentors. </p>
